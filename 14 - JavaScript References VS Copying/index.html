      // Here age2 is a copy of age
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
      // Here, team and players both change
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()
    team2[3]= 'Poppy';

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Jane';
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[4] = 'Poppy';
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Janet Clarke',
      age: 27
    }
    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    // captain.age = 18; // age = 18 for person and captain
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      name: 'Clarke',

    }

    console.log(clarke)

    const dev = Object.assign({}, clarke); // this will only be 1 level deep

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(clarke)); //better deep clone but this might affect performance
